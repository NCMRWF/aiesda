# AIESDA: Artificial Intelligence based Earth System Data Assimilation

AIESDA is a robust framework designed to bridge **AI Foundation Models** (GraphCast, Pangu-Weather, etc.) with **Dynamical Forecast Systems** (Bharat, Mithuna) and **Data Assimilation engines** like JEDI/UFO.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Model Passport**: A zero-trust multi-factor authentication system for meteorological data.
* **JEDI Model Bridge**: Automated standardization of AI outputs for Observation Operators (CRTM/RTTOV).
* **Unified Registry**: Centralized management of variable mappings and vertical grid fingerprints.

## 🛠 Installation
